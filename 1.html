        <h3><b>2022 Ukranian Refugee Crisis</b></h3>
        <h4>
            Before the invasion, the war in the Donbas had already resulted in over two million refugees and internally displaced persons since it began in 2014. The vast majority of refugees in 2022 have directly entered neighboring nations to the west of Ukraine. Poland has received more refugees from Ukraine than all other European countries combined. Other neighboring countries of Ukraine that have received refugees are Romania, Moldova, Hungary and Slovakia. Some refugees have then moved further west to other European countries and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere.
            <br><br>
            The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated on 27 February that in two months there would be 7.5 million internally displaced people in Ukraine, 12 million people will be in need of health care and the number of people fleeing the war could reach 4 million. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) stated that the situation was Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since the Second World War. By 23 March 2022, according to the UNHCR, the number of Ukrainian refugees who had left the country exceeded 3.7 million people.
            <br><br>
            By 23 March 2022, more than 2.2 million Ukrainian refugees had entered Poland. Poland greatly reduced the usual border formalities, and said that various identity documents would be accepted.
            <br><br>
            The first refugees from Ukraine arrived in Brandenburg on the evening of 25 February 2022, and the federal state was initially preparing for some 10,000 people. Other states pledged their help. In addition, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern decided to stop the forced return of people to Ukraine. The German national railway allowed refugees with a Ukrainian passport or ID card to travel free of charge on long-distance trains from Poland to Germany, the Association of German Transport Companies decided to also cancel charges for all short-distance travel with buses and trains for Ukrainian refugees within Germany.
            German media debated whether there was a difference in the portrayal of refugees from Ukraine compared to those from other countries, particularly those arriving during the 2015 European migrant crisis.
            <br><br>
            This is a true tragedy... We must hope that the war ends soon...
